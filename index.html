    <pre>when comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also
special in  that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by Javascript.
    
In CSS selectors are used to target a specific element or range of element on a web page. once an element has been targeted, a style or  set of styles can be applied to the
element.

There is a wide range of selectors available. two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
